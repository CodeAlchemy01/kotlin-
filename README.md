# Mobile Health FHIR Platform  

## Project Overview  
The **Mobile Health FHIR Platform** is a Kotlin-based application designed to implement offline-capable, mobile-first healthcare solutions. It enables seamless healthcare management from local community levels to national and international scales. Built on the foundation of FHIR and WHO Smart Guidelines, this project is powered by **Google's Android FHIR SDK** and **HAPI FHIR**. With over a decade of real-world experience driving its design, this platform supports healthcare workers, care teams, and patients by securely managing and transmitting healthcare data.
